ASGD can be compiled either against an external cBLAS library (provided by the
user), or against a naive cBLAS implementation (part of the ASGD distribution).

=> to make with included (slow) cBLAS:
type 'make'

=> to make providing an external (fast) cBLAS:
follow the instructions in the Makefile
type 'make'

To use the library, please link against the objects in the obj folder.
