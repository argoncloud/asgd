ASGD can be compiled either against an external cBLAS library (provided by the
user), or against a naive cBLAS implementation (part of the ASGD distribution).

=> to make with included (slow) cBLAS:
type 'make'

=> to make providing an external (fast) cBLAS:
follow the instructions in the Makefile
type 'make'

To ensure that the external cBLAS implementation provides all the necessary
functions, please refer to simple_blas/simple_blas.h

After compiling, please link against the dynamically or statically library
under the lib/ folder. Headers are available in the include/ folder.
